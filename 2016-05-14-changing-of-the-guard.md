When I was on the outside of full time iOS development, I found [this site](http://subjc.com) to be an invaluable resource for continuing to learn about innovative interfaces in iOS. Now that I've been writing iOS apps fulltime for the past 15 months, I've understood that there is a lot I have learnt about building iOS apps. Having talked with [Sam](https://twitter.com/sampage), I asked if I could start writing some articles for subjective-c.

Graciously and kindly he provided me with access to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/subjc) that provides content for the site and permission to create some new content.

For those that were at [Melbourne Cocoaheads](http://melbournecocoaheads.com) in May 2016, I talked about UICollectionViewLayout and how to make a custom layout. As that topic is rather intense, I thought it would be good to form the basis of a post that will appear shortly.

So, I shall tip my hat to Sam and say thank you for the articles written thus far. I hope to do justice to the depth of analysis that has been the standard of articles here.

If you have a suggestion of an innovative interface to analyse or would like to contribute a post, please [get in touch via twitter](https://twitter.com/mattdelves).
