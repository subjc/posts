Subjective-C began in part as an excuse to write. Not the writing bookended by square brackets and semi-colons but writing to exercise another part of the brain and hopefully communicate a little bit of love and knowledge on a relatively niche subject.

It's been a little over a year since the [initial commit](https://github.com/subjc/posts/commit/235a3a4a12095821adfa6581c99c68cdd54dc697) and while there was a brief period of regularity, buoyed by a remarkably humbling response from you, the reader, updates tailed off. It would be nice to have a reason for this, but unfortunately all I can offer is an excuse: sometimes life gets in the way.

Incredibly overdue as it is, I'd like to give you the floor, if you'll take it. To share your love and your knowledge of a relatively niche subject.

If you're interested in taking over, [get in touch](mailto:sam@subjc.com?subject=Taking over Subjective-C).
